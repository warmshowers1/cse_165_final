# Galaga Remake
This is a recreation of the famous 1980's arcade game, Galaga.

## Controls
**A** and **D** as well as both **Left-arrow** & **Right-arrow** keys control movement of your ship.
**Space** allows your spaceship to shoot. 
Your objective is to shoot the aliens as accurately as possible.

## Problems
This game may crash or report segmentation faults based on your system. However, it has been highly inconsistent on what causes these errors. I apologize in advance if you find problems like these. 
If you have trouble compiling, please try going into the makefile and uncomment line 16, which declares the CFLAGS for compiling.
